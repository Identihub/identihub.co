                        <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Identihub, we have a few fundamental principles:<br>
						We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)<br>
						We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.<br>
						We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.<br>
						In our platform, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.<br>
						Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals. (Note: this privacy policy available under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you, and we’d appreciate a link to Automattic.com, which is the organisation the created this document first.)<br>
						If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.<br>
						It is Identihub’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our platform.</p>

						<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
                        <p>Like most website operators, Identihub collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Identihub’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Identihub’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Identihub may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
						<br>Identihub also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Identihub only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

						<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                        <p>Certain visitors to Identihub’s websites choose to interact with Identihub in ways that require the Identihub team to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Identihub gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who wish to donate to provide some personal information. Those who engage in financial transactions related to the Identihub project – by purchasing a software as a services package, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Identihub collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Identihub. The Identihub team does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

						<h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>

						<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
						<p>Identihub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Identihub’s behalf or to provide services available at Identihub’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Identihub’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Identihub will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Identihub discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Identihub believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Identihub, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Identihub website and have supplied your email address, Identihub may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Identihub and our services. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request, we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Identihub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

						<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
						<p>If Identihub, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Identihub goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Identihub may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
